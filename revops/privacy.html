</div>

<div class="content">

<p>CompeteAlert ("we," "us," "Company") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

<p><strong>The short version:</strong> We collect only what we need to deliver your service. We don't sell your information. We don't share your data with competitors. You can delete your data anytime by asking us.</p>

<p>Our web server may automatically collect basic access logs (IP address, browser type, pages visited) as part of standard web hosting. This data is not used for marketing or shared with third parties.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <li><strong>Service improvement</strong> — Understanding how to make our reports more useful</li>

  <li>Selling to third parties</li>
  <li>Advertising or marketing from other companies</li>
  <li>Sharing with your competitors or other clients</li>

<h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>

</table>

<p>These providers are bound by their own privacy policies and data protection obligations. We do not sell your data to any third party.</p>

<h2>4. Cookies & Tracking</h2>

<p>Our website currently does <strong>not</strong> use cookies, tracking pixels, or third-party analytics. We believe in minimal data collection.</p>

<p>If we add analytics or tracking tools in the future, we will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Update this Privacy Policy</li>
  <li>Notify existing subscribers by email</li>
  <li>Provide opt-out options where applicable</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>

<p><strong>Active subscribers:</strong> We retain your data for as long as you maintain an active subscription, plus 90 days after cancellation (in case you want to re-subscribe).</p>

<p><strong>After cancellation:</strong> 90 days after your subscription ends, we delete your personal information and report data from our active systems. Some data may persist in encrypted backups for up to 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Deletion requests:</strong> You can request deletion of your data at any time by emailing aaron@competealert.com. We will process deletion requests within 30 days. Note that deletion means we can no longer provide our service to you.</p>

<p><strong>Free report recipients:</strong> If you received a free Competitor Snapshot but did not subscribe, we retain your contact information for up to 6 months to follow up. You can request deletion at any time.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>

<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
  <li>Secure payment processing through Square (PCI-compliant)</li>
  <li>Limited access to customer data (only authorized team members)</li>
  <li>Confidential report delivery via secure email</li>
</ul>

<p>No system is 100% secure. While we take precautions, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

<h2>7. Your Rights — California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)</h2>

<p>If you are a California resident, you have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA):</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Right to delete</strong> — You can request deletion of your personal information</li>
  <li><strong>Right to opt-out of sale</strong> — We do not sell personal information, so this right doesn't apply in practice</li>
  <li><strong>Right to non-discrimination</strong> — We will not discriminate against you for exercising any privacy right</li>
  <li><strong>Right to correct</strong> — You can request correction of inaccurate personal information</li>
  <li><strong>Right to limit use of sensitive information</strong> — We do not collect sensitive personal information as defined by CPRA</li>
</ul>

<p>To exercise any of these rights, email us at aaron@competealert.com with the subject line "CCPA Request." We will verify your identity and respond within 45 days.</p>

<p><strong>We do not sell personal information.</strong> We have not sold personal information in the preceding 12 months.</p>

<h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>CompeteAlert is a B2B service for business owners. We do not knowingly collect information from individuals under 18 years of age. If we learn that we have collected data from a minor, we will delete it promptly.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
