  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>
</div>

<div class="content">

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a legal agreement between you ("Subscriber," "you") and CompeteAlert ("we," "us," "Company"). By subscribing to or using our services, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

<p><strong>Plain English version:</strong> This is the agreement between you and CompeteAlert. We've written it to be as clear as possible because we know you're busy running a business, not reading legal documents.</p>

<h2>1. What We Do</h2>

<p>CompeteAlert provides competitive intelligence reports and monitoring services for local home service businesses. We monitor publicly available information about your competitors and deliver insights, analysis, and recommendations to help you make better business decisions.</p>

<p>Our reports include data gathered from public sources: Google Business Profiles, review sites (Google, Yelp, BBB), social media profiles, company websites, public ad libraries, job boards, and similar publicly accessible platforms.</p>

<h2>2. Data Sources & Methods</h2>

<p>All information in our reports comes from <strong>publicly available sources only</strong>. We do not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Access private accounts or password-protected systems</li>
  <li>Use hacking, social engineering, or any illegal methods</li>
  <li>Collect personal data about individual consumers</li>
  <li>Misrepresent our identity to obtain information</li>
</ul>
<p>We do what any person could do manually — check public websites, read public reviews, and view public social media — just systematized and analyzed for your benefit.</p>

<h2>3. Your Account & Confidentiality</h2>

<p>Your reports are prepared exclusively for you and your business. We will not share your reports, your competitor data, or any details about your business with other clients — including your competitors.</p>

<p>You agree to treat your reports as confidential and not distribute them publicly or share them with businesses outside your organization. You may share reports internally within your company and with your direct advisors (accountant, marketing agency, etc.).</p>

<h2>4. No Guarantee of Outcomes</h2>

<p>Our reports provide information, analysis, and recommendations — not guarantees. We cannot promise that acting on our insights will result in specific revenue, leads, or growth outcomes. Business results depend on many factors outside our control, including your execution, market conditions, and competitor responses.</p>

<p><strong>In plain English:</strong> We give you the best intelligence we can. What you do with it is up to you, and we can't guarantee specific results.</p>

<h2>5. Accuracy</h2>

<p>We make every effort to ensure our data is accurate as of the report date. However, publicly available information changes frequently. Review counts, ratings, promotions, and other data points are approximate and may have changed between collection and delivery. We do not guarantee 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>If you notice an error in a report, let us know and we'll correct it in your next report or issue an update.</p>

<h2>6. Payment Terms</h2>

<p><strong>Billing cycle:</strong> Subscriptions are billed monthly on the same date you first subscribed. For example, if you subscribe on March 15th, you'll be billed on the 15th of each following month.</p>

<p><strong>Payment method:</strong> We accept payment via Square. You authorize us to charge your payment method on file for each billing cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Failed payments:</strong> If a payment fails, we'll notify you by email and retry the charge within 3 business days. If payment fails after two retries, your account will be suspended until payment is resolved. We'll give you at least 7 days' notice before any suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Price changes:</strong> We may adjust pricing with 30 days' written notice. Price changes apply to the next billing cycle after the notice period, never mid-cycle. You may cancel before the new price takes effect.</p>

<h2>7. Cancellation & Refunds</h2>

<p><strong>Cancel anytime.</strong> No contracts, no cancellation fees, no questions asked. Email us at aaron@competealert.com or notify us in writing.</p>

<p>If you cancel mid-month, you'll retain access through the end of your current billing period. We do not offer prorated refunds for partial months.</p>

<p><strong>30-Day Money-Back Guarantee:</strong> If you're not satisfied with your first monthly report, request a full refund within 30 days of your first payment. This guarantee applies to your first month of service only.</p>

<h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>

<p><strong>Our IP:</strong> CompeteAlert retains all intellectual property rights in our reports, methodologies, analysis frameworks, tools, and processes. Our reports are protected by copyright.</p>

<p><strong>Your license:</strong> We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use your reports for your internal business purposes. You may not resell, redistribute, publicly publish, or create derivative works from our reports without our written permission.</p>

<p><strong>Your data:</strong> You retain ownership of any information you provide to us (business name, competitor names, etc.). We use this information solely to deliver your service.</p>

<h2>9. Acceptable Use</h2>

<p>You agree to use our reports and services responsibly. You may NOT use CompeteAlert reports to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make false or defamatory claims about competitors</li>
  <li>Harass, threaten, or intimidate competitors or their employees</li>
  <li>Engage in any illegal activity</li>
  <li>Create misleading advertising based on competitor data</li>
  <li>Interfere with competitors' business operations through unlawful means</li>
</ul>
<p>Violation of this acceptable use policy may result in immediate termination of your account without refund.</p>

<h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p>CompeteAlert's total liability for any claim related to our service is limited to the amount you paid us in the 3 months prior to the claim.</p>

<p>We are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages — including lost profits, lost customers, or business interruption — arising from your use of our reports or recommendations. This limitation applies regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, or otherwise).</p>

<h2>11. Indemnification</h2>

<p>You agree to indemnify and hold CompeteAlert harmless from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your use or misuse of our reports</li>
  <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
  <li>Your violation of any law or regulation</li>
  <li>Any action you take based on information in our reports</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In plain English:</strong> If someone sues us because of something you did with our reports, that's on you.</p>

<h2>12. Dispute Resolution & Arbitration</h2>

<p><strong>Informal resolution first:</strong> If you have a dispute with us, please contact us at aaron@competealert.com. We'll try to resolve it informally within 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>Binding arbitration:</strong> If we can't resolve a dispute informally, you and CompeteAlert agree to resolve it through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. Arbitration will take place in Maricopa County, Arizona, or remotely by mutual agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Class action waiver:</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis only. You waive any right to participate in a class action, class arbitration, or representative action against CompeteAlert.</p>

<p><strong>Small claims exception:</strong> Either party may bring a qualifying claim in small claims court instead of arbitration.</p>

<h2>13. Governing Law</h2>

<p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Arizona, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any legal proceedings not subject to arbitration shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Maricopa County, Arizona.</p>

<h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>

<p>We are not liable for delays or failures in performance resulting from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including natural disasters, internet outages, platform API changes, government actions, pandemics, or other force majeure events. We'll notify you promptly and resume service as soon as reasonably possible.</p>

<h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>

<p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll notify you by email at least 15 days before they take effect. Continued use of the service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance. If you disagree with the changes, you may cancel your subscription.</p>

<h2>16. Data Processing</h2>

<p>Our collection and use of personal information is described in our <a href="/privacy" style="color:#302b63">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to our data practices as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>17. Entire Agreement & Severability</h2>

<p><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and CompeteAlert regarding your use of our services. They supersede any prior agreements or communications.</p>

<p><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not waive our right to enforce it in the future.</p>
